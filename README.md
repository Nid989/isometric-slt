# Isometric Spoken Language Translation 
This repo contains dataset (_test_), recipes, and scripts to set up and evaluate an isometric translation tasks. 


## Isometric SLT Shared Task
At the [IWSLT 2022](https://iwslt.org/2022) evaluation campaign we are organizing an 
[isometric spoken language translation](https://iwslt.org/2022/isometric) task.
The task requires participants to submit their system(s) performance evaluation on the publicly available test set (MuST-C), 
and blind test set curated by the organizers. Following the evaluation timeline the blind set can be accessed 
from [./dataset/isometric-mt-test](dataset/isometric-mt-test). For evaluation scripts see [./scripts](scripts).


For more details, see shared task [evaluation](https://iwslt.org/2022/isometric#evaluation) and 
[system submission](https://iwslt.org/2022/isometric#system-submission) descriptions. 


## Isometric SLT Shared Task Baselines
_Results will be made available by the end of the evaluation period (March 25, 2022)._
